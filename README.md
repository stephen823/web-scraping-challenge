# web-scraping-challenge
The goal of this project is to create a website presenting key Mars facts and most up to date Mars weather. Python package Beautifulsoup will be used to extract the required information from NASA's website and stored in a permanent Mongo DB database. Finally, stored data will be rendered onto a designed template to create the final website.
